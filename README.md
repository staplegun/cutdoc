### Why Cutdoc? ###

__Send a screen-free message__

- We stare at screens all day and read shorter and shorter messages. How's that working for your mental health?
- People used to send special, personal letters to each other but there's a catch - you need to go outside to send them.
- With Cutdoc you get the best of both worlds - send a digital letter, but it can <span class="emphasis">only</span> be read off-line.
